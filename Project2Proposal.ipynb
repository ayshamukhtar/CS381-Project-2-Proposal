        "Crime remains a pressing issue in New York City, and informed decision-making is crucial for effective policing. To date in 2025, over 71,000 arrests have been recorded across each borough, offering a great source of data for analyzing public safety trends. Each recorded arrest has key attributes, including the level of offense, location, date, and demographic data such as age, race, and gender. Among these, the level of offense (felony, misdemeanor, or violation) serves as a critical measurement for understanding the severity of the crimes committed across the city.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examining how the level of offense varies by age group, borough, and time provides great insight into where public policy initiatives and resources can be prioritized. For instance, patterns in offense levels may highlight the need for location-based allocation of resources or adjustments to patrol schedules. By uncovering such patterns, we can make informed decisions that aim to improve public safety while ensuring a fair justice system. The insights gained from our analysis will provide the information essential for our local government and policymakers to take action in reducing crime and achieving a safer city."

        "1. What levels of offense are most commonly associated with different age groups?\n",
        "2. How does the level of offense vary across boroughs in New York City?\n",

        "### Real-World Implementation\n",
        "Understanding how the level of crimes changes depending on age, location, and time can really help police, city leaders, and local groups make better decisions. For example, if younger people are being arrested more often for smaller crimes in certain neighborhoods, it could show the need for youth programs or support. If serious crimes are happening more in certain places or at specific times, police can plan their patrols better. This kind of information can also help with making sure the justice system is fair by pointing out patterns that may show unfair treatment. Overall, this research can lead to smarter and more fair public safety plans for the city.\n",

        "For our analysis, we plan to use a combination of descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as modeling techniques. Descriptive statistics will help us understand the frequency and distribution of crimes across age groups, boroughs, and dates. Chi-square tests of independence will be used to determine whether there are statistically significant relationships between categorical variables, such as crime type and borough or age group. We will also use multinomial logistic regression to model the likelihood of different crime types occurring based on predictors like age group, borough, and time of year. To detect patterns, we will perform time-based aggregations to identify trends or seasonal trends in crime. Additionally, we may incorporate classification or clustering models such as decision trees or KMeans to uncover hidden patterns, and we will assess missing data through techniques like mode imputation, dropping sparse records, and forward-fill methods. To visually communicate our findings, we will create bar charts, heatmaps, time series plots, and potentially geospatial maps using tools like folium or geopandas. Each visualization will be clearly explained and, when applicable, supported by statistical tests"
